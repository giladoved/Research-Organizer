# Research Organizer

Let's take out the tedious parts of writing an essay and bring term papers into the 21st century! This app lets you create notecards with topic sentences, points, illustrations (with images! videos coming soon...), citations and explanations. You're able to organize the notecards by color and move them around the screen to help layout your essay. The data is backed up to a cloud so don't worry about losing what you've written. Once the notecards are done, the app will create an outline based on the order you define and if you're happy with the outline, the app creates the essay (all you need to do then is to write the transition sentences) and the citation page which you can export.
